At first it may sound simple, but as you start the testing process, you'll find out that there are many lttle things that you need to consider to avoid possible bugs. Feel free to check the code on Github. You can also clone the repository, o simply download it to play the game. Just remember that you will need to go to the <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"in-text-link\">oficial site of python</a> to get everything you need to run the code.</p>"

I also wanted to do something different regarding the styles. So the approach was a colorful and informal presentation, reminiscent of my idea of a comic book.<br><br>Finally, why choosing the MARVEL API over the other <a href=\"https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"in-text-link\">hundreds</a> of free APIs available for testing? The short answer is... I like the Marvel Universe, and I grew up with these characters. I believe everyone can run the extra mile, and deliver a better product if there is a little bit of passion involved.</p>"
