It uses cycles, conditionals, object oriented programming, functions, and many other structures. At first it may sound simple, but as you start the testing process, you'll find out that there are many lttle things that you need to consider to avoid possible bugs. Feel free to check the code on Github. You can also clone the repository, o simply download it to play the game. Just remember that you will need to go to the <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"in-text-link\">oficial site of python</a> to get everything you need to run the code.</p>"

Users can select one of ten characters from the game, browse through over 20 types of Materia, view descriptions, and add them to their cart. The checkout process involves providing a credit card (sandboxed, no real money), entering personal details, reviewing an order summary with price and terms, and completing the purchase. The frontend, built with React, is styled with SASS and heavily inspired by Final Fantasy VII menus, with matching fonts, colors, and sounds. The backend, powered by NestJS, handles user characters, products (Materia), orders, and payments, integrating with the WOMPI API for sandbox payment processing. The database uses DynamoDB with four tables corresponding to backend modules, and the infrastructure is deployed on AWS using CDK, featuring a serverless stack for Lambda and DynamoDB, and a CICD stack with CodePipeline for automated deployments.</p>"
