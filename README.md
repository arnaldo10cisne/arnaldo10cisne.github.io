# Arnaldo Cisneros' Personal Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal website, [www.arnaldocisneros.com](http://www.arnaldocisneros.com), built using **React** and **TypeScript**. This site serves as a platform to showcase my portfolio of projects, as well as the professional certificates Iâ€™ve earned throughout my career. The entire application is designed with a responsive layout, ensuring optimal performance across different devices.

## Features

- **Built with React & TypeScript**  
  The website leverages React for building reusable UI components and TypeScript for adding static types, enhancing code quality and maintainability. 

- **AWS Amplify Hosting**  
  The application is deployed on **AWS Amplify**, which provides seamless CI/CD integration, making the deployment process smooth and efficient. 

- **Custom Domain Managed via Route 53**  
  The domain **www.arnaldocisneros.com** is registered and managed using **AWS Route 53**, providing reliable and scalable DNS service to ensure high availability of the website.

- **API Integration with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB**  
  The site includes a custom **API Gateway** that routes requests to a private **AWS Lambda** function. This function retrieves relevant data from a **DynamoDB** database and returns it to the client application. This setup ensures a secure, serverless data retrieval process.

- **S3 Asset Management**  
  All static assets, such as images and files, are securely stored and served from **Amazon S3**, enabling scalable, high-performance access to resources.

- **Responsive Design**  
  The site is fully responsive, ensuring that the user experience is optimized for any screen size, from desktop to mobile devices.
