      <p>
        I was born in the city of Caracas, Venezuela. When i'm not working in my
        computer, I like to play piano, read books or play videogames. I really
        like traveling and making new friends, and I'd rather go to dinner with
        them, than going to parties and loud places. I love to have deep
        conversations with other people. And, last but not least, I'm more of a
        cat person myself.

      <h2 className="global__section_divider">About my work</h2>
      <p>
        I like to put heart on every project I begin, even more on projects
        where I can show some creativity. I've done websites, desktop
        applications, and even small videogames on Unity. I like to have a full
        picture of the project I'm going to start before writing the first lines
        of code. If I really get invested in what I'm doing, I can be a bit of a
        perfectionist.

      <h2 className="global__section_divider">About my expertise</h2>
      <p>
        Since highschool, i've always been interested in the process of creating
        software. I started programing in BASIC, and slowly moved to C++, Java,
        and finally Python and JavaScript. I consider myself very good using the
        standards in web development, those being HTML, CSS and Javascript, but
        I like to keep an open mind in terms of learning new things.
